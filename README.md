# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project includes the following steps from scratch to end.

Setup:

Create a new React project using Create React App or any other preferred method.
Install Tailwind CSS to the project using npm or yarn.
Component Creation:

Create a new functional component named RecipeApp.
State Management:

Utilize React's useState hook to manage state:
recipes: Holds an array of recipes.
name and ingredients: Hold the values of the recipe name and ingredients entered by the user.
Form Submission:

Implement a form within the RecipeApp component to allow users to add new recipes.
Define a handleSubmit function to handle form submission:
Prevent the default form submission behavior.
Create a new recipe object with the entered name and ingredients.
Add the new recipe to the recipes array.
Clear the form fields.
Displaying Recipes:

Render the added recipes within the RecipeApp component.
If no recipes have been added yet, display a message indicating that.
Use the map method to iterate over the recipes array and render each recipe with its name and ingredients.
Styling with Tailwind CSS:

Enhance the visual appearance and user experience of the application by applying Tailwind CSS utility classes:
Style the container, headings, form inputs, buttons, and recipe display.
Apply responsive utility classes to ensure the application looks good and functions well on all devices.
Testing:

Test the application by running it locally and adding, removing, and viewing recipes.
Ensure the application is responsive and functions correctly across various screen sizes and devices.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the functionality and appearance of the application, deploy it to a hosting platform of choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) to make it accessible to users.
